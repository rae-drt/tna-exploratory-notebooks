# Mapping

This set of notebooks shows how to use the key features of a mapping library called [`Folium`](https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/latest/user_guide.html). This is a powerful tool for creating interactive maps in Python, with good documnentation. 

There are 3 different types of notebook here: 
- A basic introduction to Folium is presented in [The Folium Basics](./folium_basics.ipynb), which introduces the basics of the library. This is a good starting place if you are new to Folium and not very confident with Python.
- Notebooks prefixed with `features_` demonstrate groups of similar features in Folium - with [markers](./features_markers.ipynb) showing different ways to indicate locations on a map and provide information; [overlays](./features_overlay.ipynb) showing how historic maps can be used in conjuction with modern ones; and the [further features](./features_further_functions.ipynb) showing some examples from the [Foliumn plugins](https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/latest/user_guide/plugins.html).
- Notebooks with `demo_` are worked examples, showing how different features of Folium can be used with real data to create an interactive map. [A ship chase](./demo_ship_chase.ipynb) example shows how the path of two ships can be plotted on a map, animated to show when they were in close contact.
