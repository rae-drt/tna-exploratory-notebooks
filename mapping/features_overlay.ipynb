    "- `name` provides a label for the overlayed image, used in the layer control.\n",
    "- `image` is the path to the image file - this can be local or a web address.\n",
    "- `bounds` is the area that the image should cover. This is a list of the form `[[min/south_lat, min/west_lon], [max/north_lat, max/east_lon]]`.\n",

    "- The overlay map may be using a different [projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map_projection) to the base map (typically Web Mercator, as used in OpenStreetMap and Google Maps). If a key area is lined up correctly, a difference in map projection will mean that the rest of the map will drift out of alignment. \n",

    "Overlaying multiple maps and images can provide invaluable context to historical research. This can be used to show how understandings of an area have changed over time, how political boundaries have shifted, or how the quality of maps has improved. It could also be used to provide additional context to maps of a small area, for example overlaying the troop positions within a specific battle on a map of the entire war. With the possibility to add many different layers and types of data, there are fields and tools that can be used to manage the data being displayed, making the interactive map useful to the user."
