# Prompt Engineering

This notebook introduces how to prompt engineer a generative AI model to analyse the text. For this case study, OpenAI's API is employed.

There are two examples of text analysis shown in this notebook:
- Document classification. This example shows how to classify documents to a set of definitions using the definitions of the documents as a context in the prompt.
- Sensitivity classification. This example shows how to classify a text into "sensitive" and "not sensitive" given the context and the condition. This example in turns show how to manoeuvre generative AI's default responses to meet the need of the text analysis.
