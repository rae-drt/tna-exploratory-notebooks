# Named Entity Recognition (NER)

This case study introduces [Transformer](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/) which can be fine-tuned/pre-trained for various NLP tasks. For this case study, the task of NER and named entity linking is worked upon by finetuning BERT model.

## Libraries

- [Transformer](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/index)
- [BERT](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/model_doc/bert) BERT is an "encoder only" transformer architecture.

## Dataset

- [NER training data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/namanj27/ner-dataset) Training data for Named Entity Recognition with BIO tags.
