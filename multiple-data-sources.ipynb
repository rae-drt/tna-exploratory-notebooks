    "Now that we have a handle on using Folium and entering data from our own source, we are going to start looking at incorporating data from multiple locations to produce a richer map. We are going to look at a few different areas we can draw data from, and how we can incorporate them into our maps:\n",
    "- [GeoJSON](https://geojson.org/) files. In this case we will be looking at two things to do with coastlines:\n",
    "    - Whether our paths cross them\n",
    "    - Whether the ship is close enough to them to have made a sighting\n",
    "- Weather data - and how to display it\n",
    "- Tide data - (if I can find a good source) and how to display it\n",

Searching for a \"world map shapefile\", for example, is liley to lead you to [World Bank](https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/search/dataset/0038272/World-Bank-Official-Boundaries) data. From here, we can find a link to a datasource called \"World coastlines\", which we should download. \n",

There are, however, plently of data sources - feel free to have a go at searching for your own. For the examples in this notebook, we are going to be using the coastline data from World Bank. \n",

Just like last time, we're going to install them using pip - this ensure that you've got them if you are coming to this notebook first, and if you've already got them, it won't do any harm."
