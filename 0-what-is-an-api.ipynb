    "### 0.0 - Aim of this notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook aims to introduce you to the concept of an API, how they work, and how to interact with them. This notebook is not necessary to complete the rest of the notebooks here, but may be useful to start with if you have not worked with APIs or making HTTP requests with Python before.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 0.1 - Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets start by expanding the acronym: an API is an Application Programming Interface. They are how customers (either you, or other programs) interact with a program. The API \"sits in front of\" the program itself, taking requests, and passing the instructions on to the program. \n",
    "APIs are extremely common, and many of them take human interaction. As an example, Search Engines work as an API. You, as the human, provide the search term in a UI; this is then converted into an API request by adding in factors deemed relevant, such as prior search history or time of day.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to use a Pet Store as a metaphor to exlain APIs. The roles are: the user is the person walking into the store; the API is equivalent to everything you can do within the store; and the backend/database is everything “in the back” of the store. \n",
    "\n",
    "Over the next few steps, we are going to build an API request using this metaphor, looking at each building block required."

    "\n",
    "The base path is the address - where the API \"is\". For the pet store, this is equivalent to the physical address – you need to find the store itself before you can do anything with it. What this base path looks like will depend on where the API is located. For web-hosted API's the base path will look like a URL; if it is stored locally, it may be a file path; and if it is a database, it may be a database name. \n",

To continue the metaphor, once you've reached the petstore (the API), you need to decide whether you want to interact with a specific pet, the inventory, or the employees. In simpler APIs there might just be one or two endpoints, in more complex APIs there will be several. \n",
    "\n",
    "The number and style of endpoints avaiable in an API will depend on different factors. Often, these design choices will be made with the user needs, query parameters, and data in mind. For example, when considering endpoints to search inentory in The Pet Store metaphor: if the store has a very mixed stock, it may make more sense to only have a single generic endpoint for individual pets with generalised filters; if the store specialises in cats, it may be appropriate to have an endpoint dedicated to cats with more specific qeury parameters. \n",

    "Now that we have an understanding of the different building blocks of an API, we can start to build a request.

This is a widely used, useful, and well documented library, designed to make constructing HTTP requests easy.To test it out, and practice what we've learned above, we are going to use the helpful [jsonplaceholder api](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users). This API has a few different endpoints, is designed for testing and learning, and has been provided free to use. The responses are not real data, but they are predicatable and consistent, and the API behaves as a real API would.\n",
