    "## What is an API\n",
    "\n",
    "It is best to start by expanding the acronym: an API is an Application Programming Interface. They are how customers (either you, or other programs) interact with a program. The API \"sits in front of\" the program itself, taking requests for things the program should do, and passing the instructions on to the program. \n",
    "APIs are extremely common, and many of them take human interaction. As an example, search engines all work with an API: you, as the human, provide the search term to the search app. The search app then converts this to an API query for its own database, adding in factors deemed relevant, such as prior search history or time of day.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few different metaphors that help understand APIs and how they work. Here, we are going to use the Pet Store metaphor. One advantage to this metaphor is that the roles are straightforward to understand: the human user is the person walking into the store; the API itself is equivalent to everything you can do within the store; and the backend/database is everything “in the back” of the store. \n",
    "\n",
    "Over the next few steps, we are going to build an API request, with a look at each building block required."

    "#### Base path\n",
    "\n",
    "The base path is the address - its where the API \"is\". In the pet store metaphor, this is equivalent to the physical address – you need to find the store itself before you can do anything with it. What this base path looks like will depend on where the API is located. For web-hosted API's the base path will look like a URL; if it is stored locally, it may be a file path; and if it is a database, it may be a database name. \n",
    "\n",

    "The next building block is to specify which bit of the API you want to interact with - specified by endpoints. Once you've reached the petstore (API), you need to decide whether you want to interact with a specific pet, the inventory, or the employees. In simpler APIs there might just be one or two endpoints, in more complex APIs there will be several. \n",
    "\n",
    "Different APIs will be designed to work in different ways: if the store has a very mixed stock, it may make more sense to only have a single generic endpoint for individual pets; if the store specialises in cats, it may be appropriate to have an endpoint dedicated to cats. Often, these design choices will be made with the user, the query parameters, and the data in mind. For example, having the cats split off will allow for a more useful and relevant set of query paramaters to be specified, compared to a generic endpoint requiring filters applicable to all pets."

This means you can provide a single API, but have a much broader range of information available. In documentation, this is often shown as a curly bracketed variable, such as `{branch}`."
