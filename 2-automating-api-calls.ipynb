From the [help page](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/help/discovery-for-developers-about-the-application-programming-interface-api/), there is a request for less than 3,000 requests a day, and a rate of approx 1/sec. These limits are often in place on API's to prevent from overloading the servers - if several people were to seperately run all the requests in this notebook, an accidental [DDoS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack) could occur. This is not going to happen with the requests in this notebook, but it is good practice to limit the number of requests you make, and for servers to limit the number of requests they accept.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another approach to this would be to slow down the requests - you could wait for a set period of time between each request by using the [time.sleep()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.sleep) function. \n",
    "\n",
    "2 - We are going to need to do these requests in two steps. From the documentation, we can see that start and end date, and id are all avaialable from the general search, btu the description and digitisation status are not. To get these, we need to make a second request to the [`/records/details/{id}` endpoint](https://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/API/sandbox/index#/Records). These requests will need to be for individual records, and will provide the extra information we need.\n",

    "### Children within a series\n",
    "\n",
    "With some investigation of the Discovery website browse section, we can see that major record series are split into subseries. Helpfully for automation, these subseries are numberical (for example, the Admiralty series has the subseries ADM 1, ADM 2, ADM 3, etc). \n",
    "Combining this with the `/records/children/{id}`` endpoint, we can search within a series as deep as we want (or untill the API limits are reached). We can use these results to find interesting information about the records, such as finding series which cover a specific date range, or series with a greater number of children (indicative of a larger number of records).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Code details\n",
    "\n",
    "The code for this section is more complicated, using a recursive function to search through the children. This is a function that calls itself, and is a common way of searching through nested data structures. We will take this line by line, and explain what is happening.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes on using this code and the API\n",
    "\n",
    "The main thing to be aware of is that the number of children can become very large, very fast. If this is the case, it is VERY strongly reccomended that you limit the depth to 3 levels, or 2 if the series is particularly large (such as the Admiralty series). If you do not do this, you will very quickly reach the API limits, and will be unable to make any more requests. \n",
    "\n",
    "For most of the children, the id will be a C-code. This can then be used to find the record in the discovery website. If the child has a longer b-code, this is the equivelent - it just means the record is born digital (the code is still doing what it should)."
