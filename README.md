# mapping-dead-reckoning

This going to be a Jupyter notebook that will be used to show how to use some of the functions of the mapping library Folium. 

## Data

For this, we will be using the data we've downloaded from the Discovery API - in this case, we will be using the ships logs. 

## Notes

One of the things this notebook will show is how to notice and deal with code that isn't functioning properly - as of October 2023, one of the plugins for Folium doesn't work properly, and we will need to find a workaround. If your code doesn't work while you're following along, don't worry - that's the plan, and the next stage will be to find a workaround.
