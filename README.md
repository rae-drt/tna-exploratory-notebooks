# discovery-api-notebook

Hello and welcome to this series of Jupyter notebooks that will help you get started with the Discovery API.

There are two general aims with these notebooks: 
- Showing how to work with the Discovery API, and why you might want to use (and automate) it.
- Looking into a few different things you may want to do with the data. 

The notebooks are designed to be run in order, but you can also jump around or skip a notebook if you want. The first starts off introducingt the concept of an API, with the following ones building up from there - if you already know the basics of interacting with API's, you may want to jump ahead to where we start to discuss data.
