    "#### Aims\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three key aims of this notebook:\n",
    "- Gain some understanding of the Folium plugin.\n",
    "- Deal with code that isn't behaving as expected.\n",
    "- Map some ship course data, including showing how we can convert data to multiple courses.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data \n",
    "\n",
    "In a previous notebook, we downloaded some data from Discovery while investigating how to use the Discovery API. Here, we are going to use the images we downloaded - the ships logs from the 1800's. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Starting imports\n",
    "\n",
    "We start by importing the libraries we will need. We are going to assume that you don't have the libraries installed, so we will install them as we go."

    "### Dead reckoning\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior to precision navigation systems, such as GPS, ships navigated using a techniquie called dead reckoning. This involves working from the last \"known good\" location of the ship, then using the speed and direction traveled to determine the current position. \n",
    "Tools such as sextants would have helped decrease the error, but speed and time were still valuable variables; thus they were recorded in detail and with care in the ships logs. Its these data we are going to use here. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Heading data. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the 1800's, ships navigation was less accurate than can be achived with the modern 3-digit compass. Instead, they used a [32 wind compass rose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Points_of_the_compass#32-wind_compass_rose). \n",
    "\n",
    "If we investigate the logs we've downloaded, they will contain headings such as \"ENE\" or \"NW\". These are about as accurate as ships could navigate at this point, and represent a range of headings of 11.25 degrees, which we will need to compensate for. \n",
    "\n",
    "Helpfully, we can make an assumption about these ranges, making the amount of data we need to generate more manageable. As we have to assume that the data in the log are accurate, we can assume that the ship was anywhere within the range of headings - for example, for EbN (East by North), this would be 78.75 to 90 degrees. While the ship may have followed precisely the middle of these headings for the entire leg of the journey, it is far more lilkey that they would have drifted slightly of course. This could have been minor due to waves, or major due to currents or innacurate navigation. Thus, we have to assume that the ship could have been anywhere within the range of headings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, rather than generating 1 data point for each heading, we will generate 3. At the end of each leg of the course, this will give a range of positions that the ship could be in.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sighting land\n",
    "\n",
    "This technique of estimating three points for the entire journey isn't perfect; once the ship sighted land, they would have been able to take an accurate location. In reality, this would have fixed any drift from the dead reckoning. However, to keep this Notebook approachable, we are going to assume that the ship didn't sight land until the end of the journey.

We know that Folium uses the JavaScript library (Leaflet)[https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet], and searching the web for \"Leaflet TimeStampedGeoJson\" leads us to [this page](https://github.com/python-visualization/folium/blob/main/folium/plugins/timestamped_geo_json.py) showing the code for the plugin. From here, at [line 77](https://github.com/python-visualization/folium/blob/main/folium/plugins/timestamped_geo_json.py#L77), we can find our way to the original plugin code, [here](https://github.com/socib/Leaflet.TimeDimension). This is the same repository that was lined to, with the issue that has since been fixed. \n",
