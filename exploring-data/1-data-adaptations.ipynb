    "In this pair of notebooks, we are going to show how drawing meaningful graphs of large datasets can highlight interesting features that might have otherwise been missed when looking line-by-line at the data. These two notebooks are intended as a starting point, showing examples of two fairly common graphs, with the goal that you can then apply the same techniques to your own data sets. The first of these two notebooks is going to gather a dataset from Discovery and manipulate it into pandas dataframe. The second notebook will then use the matplotlib library to draw the graphs. "

Folios 13-19: Robert McLeland Esquire, Attorney General for Van Diemen's Land; disease or hurt, 'mental aberration'. Put on sick list, 11 June 1827. Remained sick until landed at Hobart Town. Had shown some symptoms before being put on the sick list but 'as these symptoms were of a very delicate nature' the Surgeon took no notice of them and did not record them in his journal. Prior to embarkation he had been under the care of Mr Abernethy for some time, for disease of the digestive organs, induration of one of the testes, haemorrhoidal discharge and a complication of diseases, and carried with him enough medicines for the duration of the voyage. Before leaving the channel he showed indecision and requested to be put ashore at Plymouth and although he was a hypochondriac, he never consulted the Surgeon. He developed the idea that there was a conspiracy against him involving the Master of the vessel, the Principal Officer and the Surgeon. He then became convinced that the ship had arrived at Hobart Town and demanded to be set ashore, locked himself in his cabin and refused to eat, remaining there until the ship did eventually arrive. After a month ashore he was almost recovered [although he does not appear to have taken up his post]. The Surgeon attributes his breakdown to fear of the long voyage, the medical treatment he had been receiving and too much study of the law. Folio 19: Mary Page, aged 22, Convict; disease or hurt, rheumatic affection of the lower jaw, from sleeping too near the fore hatchway. Put on sick list, 15 June 1827, at sea.

There were a number of colds and pneumonic complaints among women sleeping near the fore hatchway and exposed to changes in the atmosphere.

Put on sick list, 9 July 1827, at sea. Discharged cured, 13 July 1827. She had been suckling a large male child and the Surgeon had advised her to wean him, she not being strong enough to nourish the child on a salt diet. She had also suffered fever before the voyage.\",\n",

Folio 12: 20 June 1799; note on the symptoms of yellow fever, the first symptom that occurs is a quickness of the pulse intense pain on the head and violent [itchings] attended with immediate irritability of the stomach and the whole frame succeeded by general lassitude and debility after the inflammatory stage is over an almost a total inanition prevails over the patient who appears quite unconcerned about his stage or wellfare or gives himself up to despair, this stage is almost always succeeded by a yellow tinge over the whole surface of the body with a fotid smell of the whole patient, rendering him totally unbearable a thick yellow tunic [cloaks] the white of the eyes on the third day a subsultus [tendon] affects the whole frame particularly the larlynx and throat which renders the patient incapable of deglutition the nostrils become affected and respiration extremely difficult, which is performed by the nostrils solely, a [tattling?] of the throat succeeds, when the patient expires in a most horid state of agony howling hideously and when [ashamed?] being frequently sensible to the moment of their death they exclaim, that they cannot help it, this distressfull scene terminates. The method of cure I have always practised and most of the surgeons on this station is, on the first attack of this fever, if plethora prevails, to bleed, administer a calomel purge, and apply a good sizable blister on the pit of the stomach, with blisters on the temples, which generally relieves the head and takes of the irritability of the stomach, I then throw in calomel to the amount of five grains every hour until the mouth becomes affected, I have seen mercury given in wonderfull quantities, at the same time I generally give them a strong infusion of [ginger?] which I find is the only liquid that will remain on the stomach and has a good effect, by relieving the nausea in some measure when the inflammatory stage abates, I throw in the bark and wine, in as large quantities as the patient will bear, I allow them sago and wine for their diet and open their bowels occasionally. Good wine I find is extremely beneficial in the state of apathy which occurs in this case and which I am sorry to say is not to be allowed, as also one of the symptoms and last one, is a hemorrhage from the mouth and nose, many other slight attacks have fell under my observation, which I thought useless to mention, there being the principal ones, the seldom fell the attack, till we get out to sea.

Put on sick list, 20 September 1827. Died, 18 October 1827 [folio 6]. Considered an invalid when she came on board, the Surgeon applied to Dr Travers to have her sent back. Folios 3-4: Margaret Carroll, aged 24, Convict; disease or hurt, purging, griping pains and frequent colic. Put on sick list, 1 October 1827, at sea. Discharged, [7 October 1827]. Several of the women suffered griping in their stomachs and bowels from mixing vinegar with their water to quench their thirst in the hot weather. When the Surgeon discovered the cause, he stopped their vinegar. Many cases of headache from exposure to the sun on approaching the equator, also slight diarrhoeas. The heat below decks at night was very great and, because of the convicts fighting and quarrelling at night, the aft barrier was kept closed preventing air from circulating. From 24 September 1827 lime juice and sugar, mixed with water to make half a pint, was served, three times a week wine was mixed with it. 'Margaret Carroll by her tricks, perversity of mind, withal excessively indolent, brought on a state of health teasing and approaching to chorea, refusing all food for several days together, rejecting medicine and unwilling to make any exertions to shake off this torpid state'. She declared herself well and refused further medicine after a large blister was applied to the nape of her neck. Several of the children have had cutaneous eruptions (varicella) chicken and swine pox. Towards the middle and end of the month the weather became rainy and less hot. The women resist keeping the prison clean. The Reverend Vincent and his family have required some medicine, chiefly aperients and once an emetic, their complaints obstipation and sea sickness, and one of the children worms. Folios 4-5: Catherine Cummins, aged 14, Convict; disease or hurt, headache, sickness at the stomach, pulse small and quick, 90, tongue whitish and skin moist. Put on sick list, 9 October 1827. Discharged, 20 October 1827. Of a very delicate habit, but very irritable disposition, excessively prone to fits of passion, was reported to be feverish by her mother, and convinced she would die. Folios 5-6: Mary Connor, aged 38, Convict, case continues. Suffered diarrhoea and dysenteria from the 12 October 1827. Died, 18 October 1827. The Surgeon notes it was impossible in the circumstances to open her body after death, she was sewn in to a hospital sheet and committed to the deep in the evening in the presence of all the convicts, the clergyman [Reverend Vincent] performing the service. Folios 6-7: Ellen Power, aged 21, Convict; disease or hurt, obstinate obstipatio, applied for an aperient not having passed a stool for nine days. Put on sick list, 12 October 1827. Discharged, 1 November 1827. Described as very tall (six feet), thin, spare made girl, remarkable for great indolence and inattention to herself. Her pulse became almost imperceptible and she could only speak very quietly, leading the Surgeon to fear for her life. She had refused all nourishment for a long time past. Ordered to take exercise but it was extremely difficult to get her to do so. Folios 7-8: John Robert Shaw, aged 26, [Ship's] Carpenter; disease or hurt, severe headache, great giddiness, with thirst and general sickness or nausea. Put on sick list, 20 October 1827. Discharged, 28 October 1827, but to continue on his low diet. The Surgeon remarks on his successful treatment of this case, which threatened to become a severe case of synocha. Folios 8-9: 31 October 1827, comments on the close of the month. As the ship sails south the weather has become cooler and the winds more steady, with some rain. The ship has been kept as clean as possible but 'owing to the extreme filthy disposition of the women and their reckless character, choosing rather to live in their own dirt, than be clean' the prison decks must be washed, rather than dry scraped and holy stoned, even this can only be accomplished with coercion and the prisoners are abusive and use foul language. Complaints include constipation, slight rheumatism, catarrhs with stomach derangements. The beginning of November cooler with strong breezes and hazy weather on getting further eastward and southward. The prisoners in tolerable good health considering. Some of the children still suffering cutaneous eruptions and frequent bowel disorders. This has prevented the Surgeon from vaccinating three of the children, all the convicts claim to have either had small pox or been vaccinated. Some of the women suffering apthous mouth with little ulceration of the tongue, which the Surgeon attributes to their salt diet and recommends gargles, which are effective when the prisoners can be persuaded to use them. There are often small wounds or contusions from their quarrels.\",\n",

Folio 17: numerical abstract of cases mentioned in the journal, nosologically arranged. Folios 18-20: Surgeon's general remarks. On the 22 July 1833 at the Cove of Cork, embarked on board, John Todd, master, 200 convicts, six military convicts anf four free settlers, total 210, of whom three namely Daniel Sheehan, Patrick Burke and john Sullivan, did not appear in health. However, Sheehan landed at Sydney, Sullivan, the only person (a boy of 13 years) whom I objected to, after several physical attacks, rallied, and landed in health, but of exceedingly delicate habit. Burke died.The embarkation of the convicts was more hurried than the surgeon had wished. The surgeon attributed the cause of so many bowel complaints to the sudden change from dry heat to cold moisture, choking perspiration and determining to the intestines. Also mentioned that the Irish convicts (as these were) being so ill fed in their own country do not bear the long passage or the vissitudes of climate so well as there more pampered neighbours. Included in the remark is the surgeon's [Robert Dickson] opinion of the way in which several naval surgeons have boasted of their great success in taking out convicts without losing a man, and instead of filling this journal with a repetition of successful cases the surgeon [Robert Dickson] inserted the most severe, most fatal cases.\",\n",

      "                \"description\": \"Folios 31-35: Surgeon's general remarks. The sick list during the period of this journal throws a more favourable light on the health of the crew than previous journals. The reason being that the ship was in localities where febrile or epidemic diseases are rarely caused from malaria. There were 337 on the list, of which 330 were discharged cured, 5 sent to hospital or sick quarters and 2 died. Febrile complaints were generally remittant or intermittent varieties, a few were the result of malaria while surveying in the Philippine Islands and north west Borneo. Intermittents were usually of the tertian type. The various inflammatory complaints, from simple furunculi to phlegmonous erysipelas, are grouped under the order phlegmasia. The surgeon discusses the various causes and treatments. Under the heading 'Bronchitis and hepatitis' the surgeon discusses the case of Lieutenant John Robertson, 'an officer predisposed to bronchitis and other signs of indicative of tubercular deposit in his lungs, with chronic hepatitis, tubes messentericas and probably Bright's disease of the kidney'. There was one case of pneumonia, William Vinson, a cook, he had been convalescent for a few days when an asthmic fever seized him from which he died. His death probably due to the active treatment of the pneumonia and visceral complications, such as the bifurcation of the ileum found at autopsy. Rheumatic and neuralgic complaints arose from seamen sleeping on the upper deck, contrary to orders, and exposing themselves to the night air. The surgeon discusses bleeding and colchicum as well as other treatments for rheumatism, and its causes. For neuralgia he uses arsenic, quinine and carbonate of iron. He has successfully used moxa for lumbago and 'the feigned complaints that are sometimes met with in ships of war' but has only tried acupuncture once. A febrile catarrhus, resembling influenza, affected 60 of the crew near Java in July, although 48 were only slight cases and did not go into the sick report, the remaining 12 were taken off duty. The surgeon had not heard of a similar disease occurring anywhere except Anger [Anyer?], a town on the western side of Java. Symptoms and treatment are discussed and there is a brief account of its progress and the state of the weather. The natives of Anger attributed it to unusual dry weather with dew and cool night winds and went about with their heads bound in a handkerchief with a patch of green leaves at each temple. The surgeon later learned these were of strychnos ignatia, used in treating headaches and the beans were useful in cholera and dysentery. As proof of the 'insalubrity of the climate of Java' the surgeon offers the observation that trifling wounds became foul sloughing ulcers. He discusses the influence of winds in epidemics, giving the example of two fleets sailing from England in [1782] with influenza aboard, the fleet bound for France having to turn back, and Dr Cunningham's observation that epidemics in New South Wales generally follow hot northerly winds. His opinion is that in catarrhus, influenza, cholera and the 'West India fever', 'that the idea of their originating from contagion is sophistical' and that epidemics arise from 'alterations of the weather and peculiarity of temperament or constitution'. Fluxes with fever were not numerous but one man died of dysentery after chronic diarrhoea. The loser part of the ileum and colon presented ulceration of the mucous membrane, there was extensive disease of the sigmoid flexure and rectum, which was of 'carthilaginous thickness and seemed a perfect mass of disease'. Diarrhoea was frequent and troublesome, there were 3 chronic cases. The treatment and various medicines is discussed. The natives of Manila are mentioned as using 'injections of wild lettuce' and at Singapore a fruit called 'lichi' [lychee] is used in chronic diarrhoea and dysentery. The surgeon prescribed 3 or 4 daily for patients with severe bowel complaints. Dyspepsia, or 'complaints originating in functional disturbances of the stomach and liver, from errors in diet etc', were frequent but speedily removed by emetics and active purgatives. The rarity of primary venereal disease during the year is due to the withdrawal of general leave to the crew. There were some cases among the junior officers which were easily treated. Ulcers assumed an unhealthy look and became sloughy in the vicinity of Java in July. The cause could only be attributed to climatic influence. A number of treatments are mentioned which were tried with little success. Only two cases are worth mentioning under the heading wounds and accidents, that of Theodor Miguel's gunshot wound and William Parker's fractured femur and patella. Liston's long splint was used and caused considerable irritation of the groin and buttocks, 'whilst the swollen and inflamed condition of the thigh and knee prevented the application of means indispensable for opposing too great a retraction of the fragments of the patella'. Folio 35: General abstract of the sick book between the 18th of November 1842 and the 18th of January 1847, being the whole period of the ship's commission. A table showing diseases and numbers admitted, discharged, sent to hospital, dead and invalided. Total number of admissions is 1669, of which 1615 were discharged cured, 32 sent to hospital, 12 invalided and 10 died. The ship's complement was 200. Folios 36-38: Observations on the sea snakes of the Southern Ocean. Although not equipped with poisonous fangs, one of these snakes bit an officer of the HMS Woolf who died within a few hours. With watercolour illustration of three snakes on folio 36 and 'brief directions issued for the guidance of officers in boats, owing to the capture of a large venomous cobra, 7 feet long, whilst swimming across one of the rivers of Borneo'. The directions recommend that crews should not handle snakes until 'strangled or otherwise killed'. Folios 38-39: Observations: On the entada pursetha [entada pursaetha], the gago of the Philippines and Gela of India; On the Cassia Alata or Acapuleo; Notes on the Quisqualis Spinosa, the [Niogniogen] of the Philippines. The observations are on the medicinal qualities of the plants. With a watercolour on folio 39 of the Cassia Alata or Acapuleo of Manila, signed Arthur Adams [delt]. Folio 40: Blank. Folio 41: A sketch of a young Symnopithecus Nasalis [Semnopithecus Nasalis] of Borneo. With note 'skin sent to Haslar Museum'.\",\n",

      "                \"description\": \"Folio 12: Robert Pitt, aged 39, Able Seaman; disease or hurt, dysentery. Put on sick list, 3 January 1846, at Manila. Discharged, 13 February 1846. 'Of leucophlegmatic temperament', he had experienced painful purgations for 10 days before reporting to the surgeon. He relapsed on the 21st and was cured on the 28th of March and warned to take care of his diet and avoid tobacco. Folio 13: William Howard, aged 36, Able Seaman; disease or hurt, diarrhoea. Put on sick list, 4 December 1846. Discharged to Haslar Hospital, 1 January 1847. He had been subject to diarrhoea for the last 3 years and was treated in hospital in Hong Kong in the spring of 1845, after which he was well until November [1846]. Folios 13-14: John Brock, aged 26, Able Seaman; disease or hurt, catarrhusus. Put on sick list, 10 July 1846, off the island of Java. Discharged, 26 July 1846. A short, muscular man who reported sick with a violent cold, contracted by sleeping on the upper deck, exposed to the night air. Several of the crew had been sleeping on deck, against orders, in order to avoid the crowded lower deck where the temperature at night often rose to 96 degrees Fahrenheit. There was an epidemic of this disease in July, off the coast of Java, due to some peculiarity in the constitution of the atmosphere'. Folios 14-15: Henry Stevens, aged 20, Boy 1st Class; disease or hurt, ulcers. Put on sick list, 11 July 1846, at Anjei [Anyer], Java. Discharged, 23 September 1846. 'Of short stature, stout make and swarthy complexion, he had an ulcer the size of \\u00bd a crown, on the dorsum of his right foot. About 7 days previously a portion of skin on the instep was accidentally rubbed off and 2 days later it looked inflamed, subsequently the ulcer formed. The ulcer deepened until it exposed the tendons of his foot. Includes the surgeon's remarks on a number of similar cases at about the same time. He was informed at the Dutch settlement of Augei [Anyer] that affections of this kind occasionally troubled Europeans and were due to peculiarity of atmosphere. To prevent the spread of the disease each of the patients was given their own sponges and basins and kept apart from the rest of the crew. Folios 15-16: Simon Windsor, aged 25, Ordinary Seaman; disease or hurt, rheumatismus. Put on sick list, 23 August 1846. Discharged, 12 October 1846. Stated that 10 days previously after getting wet he was attacked with pains in his limbs and a cough which troubled him on going to bed. He had pain of his right side, increased on drawing breath, and his head was drawn on one side and the muscles there tender to the touch, his wrist and ankle joints were swollen. The case was of acute or arthritic rheumatism followed by neuralgia of the left ulnar nerve and [aponcuroses] of temporal fasciae and recipta frontalis muscles after wet and cold. The first was cured by bleeding and purging with colchicum and sudorifics at night and calomel, the second apparently from the sulphate of iron internally aided by anodyne liniments, epipastics and endermic use of strychnine. Folios 16-18: Mr John S Robertson, aged 32, Lieutenant; disease or hurt, chronic hepatitis. Put on sick list, 12 May 1846. Discharged to sick quarters at Singapore, readmitted to the sick list 18 June 1846, discharged to hospital at Simon's Town, Cape of Good Hope, 24 September 1846. The previous January he was exposed to wet weather in an open boat, after which his clothes were allowed to dry on him. He was treated afterwards for rheumatism of the right knee and pleurodynia. In May he complained of restlessness at night, loss of appetite, debility and emaciation, short dry cough, increased on getting in or out of bed and by speaking loud, swollen right knee etc. He had been in Malta Hospital in 1841 with similar symptoms and had suffered pneumonia at the end of 1845. He had had gonorrhoea before the age of 15 and repeated syphilitic affections had been treated with mercury. He was pale and emaciated, tall and slight in build with a narrow chest, indicating, with the coughing, anorexia and debility, a phthisical habit with a probability of functional derangement of the hepatic system. He returned from sick quarters at Singapore on 17 June without the expected benefit. On 3 September, the surgeon notes that as th ship had been at Mauritius for 10 days he had consulted with Dr Jones of HMS President and Staff Surgeon Robertson, who recommended change of climate. He was sent to the Naval Hospital at Simon's Town in a very precarious state of health, but with some expectation of the climate proving beneficial. Folio 18: Theodoro Miguel, aged 34, Spanish Refugee; disease or hurt, gunshot wounds of right arm. Put on sick list, 22 April 1846, off Borneo. Discharged, 20 May 1846. He had been captured by Bornean pirates at Manila 3 years previously and made a slave. He had escaped on board the Samarang a few days before his injury. From his knowledge of the Malay language he usually accompanied the Captain on surveying excursions. Whilst on one such expedition he was shot in the arm from a thicket close by, the musket ball entering the outside of the arm and exiting 2 inches away. Folio 19: Henry Hurneyman, aged 20, Ordinary Seaman; disease or hurt, fractura phalanges primi pollicis pedis. Put on sick list, 3 April 1846, at sea off the island of Borneo. Discharged, 24 April 1846. Fractured great toe of the right foot by a 7lb rock falling 10 feet on to it while setting up surveying marks. Folios 19-20: George Langlands, aged 22, Seaman; disease or hurt, diarrhoea. Put on sick list, 29 October 1846, at Hong Kong. Discharged, 8 June 1846. Tall and lightly made, having light hair and pale waxy complexion without much muscular development, he had been on the sick list 8 times in the past year and had been prone to diarrhoea since first being seized off the coast of Borneo in 1843. He was treated with calilaban, a species of bastard cinnamon, used at the Spanish settlement of Sambranyan, in the island of Mindanao, where it grows in great abundance. Folio 21: John Boer, aged 26, Able Seaman of the Carpenter's Crew; disease or hurt, rheumatismus. Put on sick list, 23 December 1845. Discharged, 21 February 1846. Described as a man whose conduct has been suspicious of late and by birth a foreigner. He had joined the ship from the hospital ship at Hong Kong when her crew was being reduced in 1844. He complained of severe pains in the back, similar to lumbago, pains of the extremities with weakness and stiffness of the affected parts. He attributed his symptoms to the exertion of sawing planks. He insisted that his back was broken and he could not stand erect, going about the deck on his knees. The surgeon was convinced his symptoms were feigned and had him watched covertly, confirming his suspicions. He prescribed the moxa, made by steeping lint into a solution of nitrewhich was applied on either side of the lumbar vertebrae. He at first stood the pain but very soon he jumped nimbly about, uttering imprecations. The surgeon gave him his opinion of his conduct and the seriousness of his offence and the punishment that would follow any complaint made to the Captain. He was afterward punished for misconduct and using offensive language to his superiors.\",\n",

      "                \"description\": \"Folios 20-23: Surgeon's general remarks. The surgeon has little to add to what has been said about specific diseases in the quarterly returns and will instead record general observations that have occurred during the period. Some of the diseases, such as, phlogosis, catarrhus, cephalalgia, diarrhoea, colica, vulnus and contusio, are typical of ships of war and will always occur, whatever the circumstances. The more aggravated forms tend to be inflammatory diseases and should be easily attributed. Chronic forms are usually found in older seamen, of long service or of long continuation in the tropics, typically, hepatitis, phthisis incipiens, asthma, pneumonia or bronchitis, also dysenteria and rheumatism. Once induced these are liable to return on slight causes in chronic form. Having discussed the prevalent diseases the surgeon goes on to discuss the exceptions detailed in the journal, starting with the \\u0091determinated visceral disease\\u0092 which followed on from severe colica flatulenta. The patient was sent to hospital but returned with his constitution enfeebled and with \\u0091other viscera\\u0092 implicated in the disease. The surgeon discusses the diseases tendency to return particularly when patients have been irregular in their habits, and how disease in any part of the digestive tract must eventually affect the whole body. In the tropics only temporary relief from such conditions can be expected. The two cases that were struck by lightning exhibited vastly different effects, from \\u0091almost entire annihilation of the constitutional energies, through the severe shock sustained in the nervous systems generally\\u0092, to ptosis and loss of vision. The effects of lightning are always dreadful if not fatal, especially at sea, and it is one of the most dangerous things a sailor faces in performing his duties. Both cases recovered to some extent but not entirely, the one being left with \\u0091considerable constitutional enervation and nervous debility\\u0092 and being invalided in consequence, and the other unlikely to fully recover his sight. Since there is little to be added to comments already made on the common ailments affecting sailors in the West Indies, the surgeon goes on to discuss the coast of Central America and ports trading with Jamaica, particularly in respect to disease. The coast is extensive but with few important ports, generally those of capital cities. The coast is low, \\u0091its surface verdant, overrun with parasites of various description\\u0092, with a rich soil beneath thick woods, \\u0091a pregnant source at all times for impure exhalations\\u0092. The interior is more diversified and luxuriant and fertile, producing a variety of crops of commercial value as well as fruits and vegetables, much of which \\u0091yet remains to be rendered available\\u0092. Climate along the coast is influenced by the season, the seasons distinguished as wet or dry. The wet season, from May to November, has light and variable winds, heavy rain and violent thunder and lightning, the air intensely heated, \\u0091soliciting from the moistened soil, continuous intense and impure exhalations\\u0092. The dry season has refreshing diurnal sea breezes and occasional showers. The wet season is in general not so long or continuous in more Eastern parts, in these parts there are two rainy and two dry seasons; rainy from December to February and again from June to August. The parts of the coast most frequently visited, Carthagena, Santa Martha, Chagres and Nicaragua, \\u0091come more in the limits of the rains\\u0092, particularly the latter two. Chagres in particular is notable for giving rise to both continuous and intermittent fevers and is of considerable importance, with Panama, for the transfer of [swails], specie etc. This part of the coast is particularly prone to promotion of disease being densely wooded and uncleared with incessant heavy rain, and a heated and electrical atmosphere. Intermitting fevers are more common, both among natives and Europeans. In seamen intermittent and remittent fevers are produced of a not very active character, approaching synochus. The two cases in the past year both originated on this coast. \\u0091Marsh miasmata, or the effluvia arising from stagnant water, marshy ground or densely wooded countries, when acted upon by heat, are the most frequent exciting causes of this fever\\u0092. In marshes putrefaction of vegetable and animal matter contributes a peculiar quality to the miasmata and it may be presumed that moist atmosphere promotes its action. The disease is also strikingly susceptible to renewal from slight causes and without the repetition of the original causes; the last case noted resulted from a change from a dry to a moist wind. The recurrence of this disease suggests that it leaves a predisposition in the habit, unlike most continued fevers, which once cured leave an individual less susceptible. The politics of the region has never been sufficiently settled for the leaders of these countries to look beyond the major towns to the isolated communities, in the forests or along the coast, where disease is prevalent. The poverty and hardships faced by these communities predispose them to disease and to its renewal on slight causes. The surgeon goes on to consider \\u0091by comparative inference its infrequency amongst seamen as likewise why Europeans suffer its attack on crossing this country\\u0092. The Europeans are mercantile travellers, travelling on bad roads with no shelter and little opportunity for rest or change of clothing, making them prone to the influence of the powerful surrounding miasma. In serving on this station for 7 years, the surgeon has seen only 15 cases amongst seamen, who are not exposed to the same causes and are on vessels where careful attention is paid to cleanliness, ventilation and avoiding damp between decks, excellent provisions, bedding and clothing are provided. Where it does occur it is among seamen who have worked on or visited the shore either when disease was prevalent or, who have worked in conditions promoting a predisposition to attack. He concludes by saying that the causes of disease will remain until \\u0091some further steps are taken more suitable to rid the country of its superabundant woods\\u0092.

Folios 34-35: Surgeon's general remarks. Many cases were not recorded in the journal because they were slight, terminated favourably and would have been repetitious to record. There was no contagion, the continued fever that proved fatal was from some local affection of the brain and the intermittent fevers arose from cold and fatigue. There were many more cases of dysentery, scurvy and ulcers than have been recorded. Everyone with an ulcer was allowed five or six fresh lemons a day. Intermittent fevers were frequently slight and paroxysms were prevented by large doses of the Peruvian bark before they were expected. The ship was damp from cruising with the lower ports open a great deal of the time. The Swiftsure was in general cruising off the Canaries or in the Mediterranean, so fresh meat and vegetables were not as easy to procure as they might have been. Captain Hallowell was exceptionally kind to the sick, supplying them with tea every day and good food. There were always sufficient fresh lemons to allow four or five a day to every man with ulcers or any sign of scurvy and also fever. The surgeon apologises for having taken supplies of medicine and stores from the hospital at Lisbon, Peruvian bark and bedding was needed but the surgeon of the hospital would not separate the items so he was obliged to take it all. A great deal of attention was paid to keeping the ship clean and as comfortable as possible. Three men were constantly employed as sentries and nurses in the sick bay, from being so much there they became very useful. Signed, James Dalziel.\",\n",

Folios 7 \\u2013 19: General record for the year 1872. Because of the healthy nature of the station there is very little to record, there have been no serious illnesses, the most common being catarrhs, phlegmon, venereal affections, diarrhoea and rheumatism. There were a great many venereal cases and many more were not entered on the list. Secondary symptoms were numerous and treatment is discussed briefly. The regulation of prostitution and the \\u2018apprenticeship\\u2019 of prostitutes in the \\u2018Yoshiwara\\u2019 district, and the new regulations which released women into the city, are discussed, and the rise in venereal disease since. Folio 8 relates a court case involving a Chinese indentured labourer who escaped from a Peruvian ship, the Maria Luz, and alleged that he had been ill treated and kidnapped. The Master of the ship engaged Mr F V Dickins (a former Royal Navy Assistant Surgeon) as barrister who contested the claims and put forward that slavery was countenanced by the Japanese Government in the trafficking of young girls for prostitution. The Japanese authorities upheld the complaint of the escaped indentured labourer, detained the ship and released the indentured labourers. They then reformed their own laws regulating prostitution.

Folio 10: William Corfield, aged 45, Private; disease or hurt, pain in the precordial region, palpitations, cough and dyspnoea. Put on sick list, 9 December 1871. Invalided, no date given. He had been a soldier for 29 years, a sergeant in the 23rd Regiment for several years, and had served in three campaigns. He was of dissipated habits and bore an indifferent character. Folios 10 \\u2013 11: William [Yarr], aged 39, Private; disease or hurt, death by drowning, 1 July 1872. An inquest was held at which it was heard that he had been seen entering a house in the Yoshiwara district at 7pm, seen at midnight crossing a bridge by a policeman who shortly afterwards heard him falling in and ran to fetch help. It was believed he had been drinking and had fallen asleep and in hurrying back to the camp fell off the bridge. \\u2018Several deaths have occurred in this way during the last two years; and complaints have been made to the Municipal Director about the insufficiency of the bridges\\u2019. Folio 11: Robert Styles; disease or hurt, fracture of both bones of the left fore arm while practising the high jump for the garrison sports. No dates recorded. Folios 11 \\u2013 16 describe the parts of Japan visited by Assistant Surgeon Putsey on a 15 day walking tour, describes; Silk worm farming in \\u2018the Mulberry District\\u2019, the village of \\u2018Meyonachi\\u2019, a Shinto shrine, Mount Oyama, Japanese fig trees, \\u2018Saka Moto\\u2019, \\u2018Mayonoshta\\u2019 [Miyanoshita], hot springs, Hakone, \\u2018Odowana\\u2019 castle ( the treaty boundary), Inosima [Enoshima].

The surgeon casts doubt on the American claim that earthquakes had caused the mountain to sink since their expedition measured it at 16,400 feet in 1854. A brief history of the mountain is given.

Because of the healthy nature of the station there is very little to record, there have been no serious illnesses, the most common being catarrhs, phlegmon, venereal affections, diarrhoea and rheumatism. There were a great many venereal cases and many more were not entered on the list. Secondary symptoms were numerous and treatment is discussed briefly. The regulation of prostitution and the 'apprenticeship' of prostitutes in the 'Yoshiwara' district, and the new regulations which released women into the city, are discussed, and the rise in venereal disease since. Folio 8 relates a court case involving a Chinese indentured labourer who escaped from a Peruvian ship, the Maria Luz, and alleged that he had been ill treated and kidnapped. The Master of the ship engaged Mr F V Dickins (a former Royal Navy Assistant Surgeon) as barrister who contested the claims and put forward that slavery was countenanced by the Japanese Government in the trafficking of young girls for prostitution. The Japanese authorities upheld the complaint of the escaped indentured labourer, detained the ship and released the indentured labourers. They then reformed their own laws regulating prostitution.

An inquest was held at which it was heard that he had been seen entering a house in the Yoshiwara district at 7pm, seen at midnight crossing a bridge by a policeman who shortly afterwards heard him falling in and ran to fetch help. It was believed he had been drinking and had fallen asleep and in hurrying back to the camp fell off the bridge. 'Several deaths have occurred in this way during the last two years; and complaints have been made to the Municipal Director about the insufficiency of the bridges'.

The surgeon starts by saying that the medical history of only 65 persons cannot furnish much to remark on, in the absence of epidemics or contagious disease. They arrived in the Mediterranean in October 1847 and spent the winter in the Adriatic, mostly at Trieste, and from May to September in the Ionian and Aegean seas, Constantinople and Malta. Consequently, they experienced a greater range of temperature than usually found on that station. The effects were catarrhal, pulmonic and rheumatic affections in the cold and dysenteries, diarrhoeas, hepatic and 'ceribral congestions' during the hot weather. There was much more hot than cold weather. The sudden change of temperature, with no change in diet, was a strong cause of disease. The surgeon discusses the temperature on board between decks due to the vessel being made of iron. On calm days windsails provided no ventilation and the closeness was worse. While at anchor in Malta, a thermometer placed on the inside wooden sheathing in one of the after cabins reached 117 degrees Fahrenheit [47.2 Celsius], while the temperature on deck was 86 Fahrenheit [30 Celsius]. The surgeon suspects there must be a problem retaining heat in a cold climate. They suffered most from heat in calm weather and clear sunshine and at anchor in Malta, the reflected heat in the creek made it worse. The surgeon recommends that in iron vessels intended for tropical service, a non conducting substance should be placed between the iron and the wooden sheathing. Statistical analysis of the sick list shows that the daily percentage on the list was low, 2 \\u00bd %, but it varied considerably, with the highest in the summer and autumn. The average duration of cases was similar for all quarters, with the exception of that ending 30th June which had one or two chronic cases. Six cases were sent to hospital, 1 at Woolwich and the other 5 at Malta. Of those sent to hospital at Malta, three subsequently died, William Wright, N S Seabrook and Edward Browning. Browning's case shows 'the difficulty of diagnostics in acute complicated cases'. The late Dr Watt at first believed it to be advanced typhus but afterwards remarked to the surgeon that it was one of 'unusual occurrence' The post mortem was carried out by the Assistant Surgeons of the hospital, Messrs Martin and Hill, and they did not think typhus was the cause of death. Great attention was paid to cleanliness, dryness and ventilation and to proper clothing especially in the night watches. Undue exposure and fatigue were avoided. The chloride of zinc was tried but the conditions were not unusual enough to test it properly. The surgeon gives his opinion that iron vessels are less subject to smells than wooden ones, although water collects between the 'limbers', it does not smell when pumped out. The airtight compartments prevent circulation of air and windsails must be used whenever possible and gratings are preferable to hatches. The chloride of zinc had been used effectively in the holds, store rooms and especially the engine rooms. The mixture of tallow, oil, cinders, ashes and inferior coal, with salt water produced a very offensive effluvia on which the chloride of zinc acted at once. It is far more effective than chloride of lime and a small portion of diluted solution in the bilge prevents any unpleasant odours or sulphurous fumes. The chloride of lime is not so soluble and so cannot be diluted so well. A solution of chloride of zinc is superior to alcohol for preserving anatomical specimens, particularly brains and livers, and especially in a warm and confined atmosphere where alcohol tends to evaporate. There were two cases of cholera, a relatively mild one at Constantinople, and a more severe, 'Asiatic' cholera, after leaving Malta. Cholera was prevalent at both places but these cases were traced to irregularities of diet. Both men recovered. The surgeon discusses some 'unusual' features of the cholera epidemic in Constantinople. It did not appear to be contagious or capable of transmission from the infected to the healthy. Cases broke out across the city and did not appear confined to one area or household. Considering the want of sanitary regulations, the ill ventilated houses, narrow streets, close bazaars, open sewerage, cemeteries in the centre of the living, in short, 'everything tending to spread a pestilential distemper', the surgeon suggests this is 'negative proof of the absence of an infectious propagation of cholera such as it appeared in Constantinople in 1848'. The surgeon dismisses an 'epidemic influence' as making it difficult to account for there being only one case in the first 8 days of the disease. He goes on to suggest diarrhoea and colica may produce a predisposition to cholera but they may themselves be attributed to the amount of cucumber, water melon and fruits that are eaten, rather than the influence of a 'specific choleraic cause'. It would be too much to suggest that cholera itself was produced from those causes. The disease was almost entirely confined to the lower orders and the attacks could be traced to irregularities in eating or drinking. The Turkish physicians considered the disease to be [algestive] fever with a prolonged and often fatal cold stage and their treatment consisted of bleeding. The mortality rate decreased but the surgeon suggests this may have been due to other causes. The two cases on the Antelope were treated as though infectious and were isolated in the fore saloon and the chloride of zinc used in cleaning utensils and bedding etc used in treatment. One boy, Jonathan Pierce, was invalided and given a pension certificate for hernia and cataracts, both conditions existed before his joining the Antelope from HMS Poictiers.

There were three deaths from fever on board this ship and one on shore at Sierra Leone, the deceased William Harris, Able Seaman and Jonn Redington, Ordinary Seaman, left the Rapid along with two men and Lieutenant Mansfield from the Waterwitch to navigate a joint prize for adjudication at the Vice Admiralty Court at Sierra Leone, during the passage three prisoners took opportunity when two men were asleep and other two aloft engaged about the sails and Lieutenant Mansfield at the helm, to rise upon them with intention of regaining possession of the ship, as a result Lieutenant Mansfield and all his men were wounded before they succeeded in overcoming them. They reached Sierra Leone with great difficulty and fatigue, two men got fever there when on board the Rolla and were sent to hospital, Harris died two days after, J. Redington recovered and rejoined his vessel. The Surgeon attributed the cause of fever that prevailed on board the ship to exposure to the dews and sun, and he stated that the convalescence from the fever was tedious, owing in his opinion that he had no quinine.\",\n",

The data from Discovery is not arranged exactly like this yet; but it is close, and the data structure we created when we ran the requests is going to make it easy to get it into the right structure. We can then perform some checks and modifications to make it easier to work with, such as ensuring that columns are all stored as the correct data type, and checking for missing data.\n",

    "We now have a large JSON file with all the data we want, as a result of the API calls in the previous cell. We also have a good understanding of what a nicely formatted dataframe looks like. The next stage is to use the `pandas` library to convert from the JSON to a dataframe. Doing so allows more powerful interactions with the dataframe, such as specifying the format of a column (e.g. that all values are dates), or filtering to only include rows that match a certain criteria.\n",

    "The first step we are going to take is to flatten the json. Having a flat json file makes it very straightforwards to convert to a dataframe; each record relates to an item in the json and a row in the dataframe, with each key in the json relating to a column in the dataframe. As with before, it can be valuable to draw the structure of the json to help visualise the result and ensure the conversion runs correctly."

Had shown some symptoms before being put on the sick list but 'as these symptoms were of a very delicate nature' the Surgeon took no notice of them and did not record them in his journal. Prior to embarkation he had been under the care of Mr Abernethy for some time, for disease of the digestive organs, induration of one of the testes, haemorrhoidal discharge and a complication of diseases, and carried with him enough medicines for the duration of the voyage. Before leaving the channel he showed indecision and requested to be put ashore at Plymouth and although he was a hypochondriac, he never consulted the Surgeon. He developed the idea that there was a conspiracy against him involving the Master of the vessel, the Principal Officer and the Surgeon. He then became convinced that the ship had arrived at Hobart Town and demanded to be set ashore, locked himself in his cabin and refused to eat, remaining there until the ship did eventually arrive. After a month ashore he was almost recovered [although he does not appear to have taken up his post]. The Surgeon attributes his breakdown to fear of the long voyage, the medical treatment he had been receiving and too much study of the law.

Put on sick list, 9 July 1827, at sea. Discharged cured, 13 July 1827.

Folio 12: 20 June 1799; note on the symptoms of yellow fever, the first symptom that occurs is a quickness of the pulse intense pain on the head and violent [itchings] attended with immediate irritability of the stomach and the whole frame succeeded by general lassitude and debility after the inflammatory stage is over an almost a total inanition prevails over the patient who appears quite unconcerned about his stage or wellfare or gives himself up to despair, this stage is almost always succeeded by a yellow tinge over the whole surface of the body with a fotid smell of the whole patient, rendering him totally unbearable a thick yellow tunic [cloaks] the white of the eyes on the third day a subsultus [tendon] affects the whole frame particularly the larlynx and throat which renders the patient incapable of deglutition the nostrils become affected and respiration extremely difficult, which is performed by the nostrils solely, a [tattling?] of the throat succeeds, when the patient expires in a most horid state of agony howling hideously and when [ashamed?] being frequently sensible to the moment of their death they exclaim, that they cannot help it, this distressfull scene terminates. The method of cure I have always practised and most of the surgeons on this station is, on the first attack of this fever, if plethora prevails, to bleed, administer a calomel purge, and apply a good sizable blister on the pit of the stomach, with blisters on the temples, which generally relieves the head and takes of the irritability of the stomach, I then throw in calomel to the amount of five grains every hour until the mouth becomes affected, I have seen mercury given in wonderfull quantities, at the same time I generally give them a strong infusion of [ginger?] which I find is the only liquid that will remain on the stomach and has a good effect, by relieving the nausea in some measure when the inflammatory stage abates, I throw in the bark and wine, in as large quantities as the patient will bear, I allow them sago and wine for their diet and open their bowels occasionally. Good wine I find is extremely beneficial in the state of apathy which occurs in this case and which I am sorry to say is not to be allowed, as also one of the symptoms and last one, is a hemorrhage from the mouth and nose, many other slight attacks have fell under my observation, which I thought useless to mention, there being the principal ones, the seldom fell the attack, till we get out to sea.

Put on sick list, 20 September 1827. Died, 18 October 1827 [folio 6]. Considered an invalid when she came on board, the Surgeon applied to Dr Travers to have her sent back. Folios 3-4: Margaret Carroll, aged 24, Convict; disease or hurt, purging, griping pains and frequent colic. Put on sick list, 1 October 1827, at sea. Discharged, [7 October 1827]. Several of the women suffered griping in their stomachs and bowels from mixing vinegar with their water to quench their thirst in the hot weather. When the Surgeon discovered the cause, he stopped their vinegar. Many cases of headache from exposure to the sun on approaching the equator, also slight diarrhoeas. The heat below decks at night was very great and, because of the convicts fighting and quarrelling at night, the aft barrier was kept closed preventing air from circulating. From 24 September 1827 lime juice and sugar, mixed with water to make half a pint, was served, three times a week wine was mixed with it. 'Margaret Carroll by her tricks, perversity of mind, withal excessively indolent, brought on a state of health teasing and approaching to chorea, refusing all food for several days together, rejecting medicine and unwilling to make any exertions to shake off this torpid state'. She declared herself well and refused further medicine after a large blister was applied to the nape of her neck. Several of the children have had cutaneous eruptions (varicella) chicken and swine pox. Towards the middle and end of the month the weather became rainy and less hot. The women resist keeping the prison clean. The Reverend Vincent and his family have required some medicine, chiefly aperients and once an emetic, their complaints obstipation and sea sickness, and one of the children worms. Folios 4-5: Catherine Cummins, aged 14, Convict; disease or hurt, headache, sickness at the stomach, pulse small and quick, 90, tongue whitish and skin moist. Put on sick list, 9 October 1827. Discharged, 20 October 1827. Of a very delicate habit, but very irritable disposition, excessively prone to fits of passion, was reported to be feverish by her mother, and convinced she would die. Folios 5-6: Mary Connor, aged 38, Convict, case continues. Suffered diarrhoea and dysenteria from the 12 October 1827. Died, 18 October 1827. The Surgeon notes it was impossible in the circumstances to open her body after death, she was sewn in to a hospital sheet and committed to the deep in the evening in the presence of all the convicts, the clergyman [Reverend Vincent] performing the service. Folios 6-7: Ellen Power, aged 21, Convict; disease or hurt, obstinate obstipatio, applied for an aperient not having passed a stool for nine days. Put on sick list, 12 October 1827. Discharged, 1 November 1827. Described as very tall (six feet), thin, spare made girl, remarkable for great indolence and inattention to herself. Her pulse became almost imperceptible and she could only speak very quietly, leading the Surgeon to fear for her life. She had refused all nourishment for a long time past. Ordered to take exercise but it was extremely difficult to get her to do so. Folios 7-8: John Robert Shaw, aged 26, [Ship's] Carpenter; disease or hurt, severe headache, great giddiness, with thirst and general sickness or nausea. Put on sick list, 20 October 1827. Discharged, 28 October 1827, but to continue on his low diet. The Surgeon remarks on his successful treatment of this case, which threatened to become a severe case of synocha. Folios 8-9: 31 October 1827, comments on the close of the month. As the ship sails south the weather has become cooler and the winds more steady, with some rain. The ship has been kept as clean as possible but 'owing to the extreme filthy disposition of the women and their reckless character, choosing rather to live in their own dirt, than be clean' the prison decks must be washed, rather than dry scraped and holy stoned, even this can only be accomplished with coercion and the prisoners are abusive and use foul language. Complaints include constipation, slight rheumatism, catarrhs with stomach derangements. The beginning of November cooler with strong breezes and hazy weather on getting further eastward and southward. The prisoners in tolerable good health considering. Some of the children still suffering cutaneous eruptions and frequent bowel disorders. This has prevented the Surgeon from vaccinating three of the children, all the convicts claim to have either had small pox or been vaccinated. Some of the women suffering apthous mouth with little ulceration of the tongue, which the Surgeon attributes to their salt diet and recommends gargles, which are effective when the prisoners can be persuaded to use them. There are often small wounds or contusions from their quarrels.\",\n",

Folio 17: numerical abstract of cases mentioned in the journal, nosologically arranged. Folios 18-20: Surgeon's general remarks. On the 22 July 1833 at the Cove of Cork, embarked on board, John Todd, master, 200 convicts, six military convicts anf four free settlers, total 210, of whom three namely Daniel Sheehan, Patrick Burke and john Sullivan, did not appear in health. However, Sheehan landed at Sydney, Sullivan, the only person (a boy of 13 years) whom I objected to, after several physical attacks, rallied, and landed in health, but of exceedingly delicate habit. Burke died.The embarkation of the convicts was more hurried than the surgeon had wished. The surgeon attributed the cause of so many bowel complaints to the sudden change from dry heat to cold moisture, choking perspiration and determining to the intestines. Also mentioned that the Irish convicts (as these were) being so ill fed in their own country do not bear the long passage or the vissitudes of climate so well as there more pampered neighbours. Included in the remark is the surgeon's [Robert Dickson] opinion of the way in which several naval surgeons have boasted of their great success in taking out convicts without losing a man, and instead of filling this journal with a repetition of successful cases the surgeon [Robert Dickson] inserted the most severe, most fatal cases.\",\n",

      "        \"description\": \"Folios 31-35: Surgeon's general remarks. The sick list during the period of this journal throws a more favourable light on the health of the crew than previous journals. The reason being that the ship was in localities where febrile or epidemic diseases are rarely caused from malaria. There were 337 on the list, of which 330 were discharged cured, 5 sent to hospital or sick quarters and 2 died. Febrile complaints were generally remittant or intermittent varieties, a few were the result of malaria while surveying in the Philippine Islands and north west Borneo. Intermittents were usually of the tertian type. The various inflammatory complaints, from simple furunculi to phlegmonous erysipelas, are grouped under the order phlegmasia. The surgeon discusses the various causes and treatments. Under the heading 'Bronchitis and hepatitis' the surgeon discusses the case of Lieutenant John Robertson, 'an officer predisposed to bronchitis and other signs of indicative of tubercular deposit in his lungs, with chronic hepatitis, tubes messentericas and probably Bright's disease of the kidney'. There was one case of pneumonia, William Vinson, a cook, he had been convalescent for a few days when an asthmic fever seized him from which he died. His death probably due to the active treatment of the pneumonia and visceral complications, such as the bifurcation of the ileum found at autopsy. Rheumatic and neuralgic complaints arose from seamen sleeping on the upper deck, contrary to orders, and exposing themselves to the night air. The surgeon discusses bleeding and colchicum as well as other treatments for rheumatism, and its causes. For neuralgia he uses arsenic, quinine and carbonate of iron. He has successfully used moxa for lumbago and 'the feigned complaints that are sometimes met with in ships of war' but has only tried acupuncture once. A febrile catarrhus, resembling influenza, affected 60 of the crew near Java in July, although 48 were only slight cases and did not go into the sick report, the remaining 12 were taken off duty. The surgeon had not heard of a similar disease occurring anywhere except Anger [Anyer?], a town on the western side of Java. Symptoms and treatment are discussed and there is a brief account of its progress and the state of the weather. The natives of Anger attributed it to unusual dry weather with dew and cool night winds and went about with their heads bound in a handkerchief with a patch of green leaves at each temple. The surgeon later learned these were of strychnos ignatia, used in treating headaches and the beans were useful in cholera and dysentery. As proof of the 'insalubrity of the climate of Java' the surgeon offers the observation that trifling wounds became foul sloughing ulcers. He discusses the influence of winds in epidemics, giving the example of two fleets sailing from England in [1782] with influenza aboard, the fleet bound for France having to turn back, and Dr Cunningham's observation that epidemics in New South Wales generally follow hot northerly winds. His opinion is that in catarrhus, influenza, cholera and the 'West India fever', 'that the idea of their originating from contagion is sophistical' and that epidemics arise from 'alterations of the weather and peculiarity of temperament or constitution'. Fluxes with fever were not numerous but one man died of dysentery after chronic diarrhoea. The loser part of the ileum and colon presented ulceration of the mucous membrane, there was extensive disease of the sigmoid flexure and rectum, which was of 'carthilaginous thickness and seemed a perfect mass of disease'. Diarrhoea was frequent and troublesome, there were 3 chronic cases. The treatment and various medicines is discussed. The natives of Manila are mentioned as using 'injections of wild lettuce' and at Singapore a fruit called 'lichi' [lychee] is used in chronic diarrhoea and dysentery. The surgeon prescribed 3 or 4 daily for patients with severe bowel complaints. Dyspepsia, or 'complaints originating in functional disturbances of the stomach and liver, from errors in diet etc', were frequent but speedily removed by emetics and active purgatives. The rarity of primary venereal disease during the year is due to the withdrawal of general leave to the crew. There were some cases among the junior officers which were easily treated. Ulcers assumed an unhealthy look and became sloughy in the vicinity of Java in July. The cause could only be attributed to climatic influence. A number of treatments are mentioned which were tried with little success. Only two cases are worth mentioning under the heading wounds and accidents, that of Theodor Miguel's gunshot wound and William Parker's fractured femur and patella. Liston's long splint was used and caused considerable irritation of the groin and buttocks, 'whilst the swollen and inflamed condition of the thigh and knee prevented the application of means indispensable for opposing too great a retraction of the fragments of the patella'. Folio 35: General abstract of the sick book between the 18th of November 1842 and the 18th of January 1847, being the whole period of the ship's commission. A table showing diseases and numbers admitted, discharged, sent to hospital, dead and invalided. Total number of admissions is 1669, of which 1615 were discharged cured, 32 sent to hospital, 12 invalided and 10 died. The ship's complement was 200. Folios 36-38: Observations on the sea snakes of the Southern Ocean. Although not equipped with poisonous fangs, one of these snakes bit an officer of the HMS Woolf who died within a few hours. With watercolour illustration of three snakes on folio 36 and 'brief directions issued for the guidance of officers in boats, owing to the capture of a large venomous cobra, 7 feet long, whilst swimming across one of the rivers of Borneo'. The directions recommend that crews should not handle snakes until 'strangled or otherwise killed'. Folios 38-39: Observations: On the entada pursetha [entada pursaetha], the gago of the Philippines and Gela of India; On the Cassia Alata or Acapuleo; Notes on the Quisqualis Spinosa, the [Niogniogen] of the Philippines. The observations are on the medicinal qualities of the plants. With a watercolour on folio 39 of the Cassia Alata or Acapuleo of Manila, signed Arthur Adams [delt]. Folio 40: Blank. Folio 41: A sketch of a young Symnopithecus Nasalis [Semnopithecus Nasalis] of Borneo. With note 'skin sent to Haslar Museum'.\",\n",

'Of leucophlegmatic temperament', he had experienced painful purgations for 10 days before reporting to the surgeon. He relapsed on the 21st and was cured on the 28th of March and warned to take care of his diet and avoid tobacco. Folio 13: William Howard, aged 36, Able Seaman; disease or hurt, diarrhoea. Put on sick list, 4 December 1846. Discharged to Haslar Hospital, 1 January 1847. He had been subject to diarrhoea for the last 3 years and was treated in hospital in Hong Kong in the spring of 1845, after which he was well until November [1846]. Folios 13-14: John Brock, aged 26, Able Seaman; disease or hurt, catarrhusus. Put on sick list, 10 July 1846, off the island of Java. Discharged, 26 July 1846. A short, muscular man who reported sick with a violent cold, contracted by sleeping on the upper deck, exposed to the night air. Several of the crew had been sleeping on deck, against orders, in order to avoid the crowded lower deck where the temperature at night often rose to 96 degrees Fahrenheit. There was an epidemic of this disease in July, off the coast of Java, due to some peculiarity in the constitution of the atmosphere'. Folios 14-15: Henry Stevens, aged 20, Boy 1st Class; disease or hurt, ulcers. Put on sick list, 11 July 1846, at Anjei [Anyer], Java. Discharged, 23 September 1846. 'Of short stature, stout make and swarthy complexion, he had an ulcer the size of \\u00bd a crown, on the dorsum of his right foot. About 7 days previously a portion of skin on the instep was accidentally rubbed off and 2 days later it looked inflamed, subsequently the ulcer formed. The ulcer deepened until it exposed the tendons of his foot. Includes the surgeon's remarks on a number of similar cases at about the same time. He was informed at the Dutch settlement of Augei [Anyer] that affections of this kind occasionally troubled Europeans and were due to peculiarity of atmosphere. To prevent the spread of the disease each of the patients was given their own sponges and basins and kept apart from the rest of the crew. Folios 15-16: Simon Windsor, aged 25, Ordinary Seaman; disease or hurt, rheumatismus. Put on sick list, 23 August 1846. Discharged, 12 October 1846. Stated that 10 days previously after getting wet he was attacked with pains in his limbs and a cough which troubled him on going to bed. He had pain of his right side, increased on drawing breath, and his head was drawn on one side and the muscles there tender to the touch, his wrist and ankle joints were swollen. The case was of acute or arthritic rheumatism followed by neuralgia of the left ulnar nerve and [aponcuroses] of temporal fasciae and recipta frontalis muscles after wet and cold. The first was cured by bleeding and purging with colchicum and sudorifics at night and calomel, the second apparently from the sulphate of iron internally aided by anodyne liniments, epipastics and endermic use of strychnine. Folios 16-18: Mr John S Robertson, aged 32, Lieutenant; disease or hurt, chronic hepatitis. Put on sick list, 12 May 1846. Discharged to sick quarters at Singapore, readmitted to the sick list 18 June 1846, discharged to hospital at Simon's Town, Cape of Good Hope, 24 September 1846. The previous January he was exposed to wet weather in an open boat, after which his clothes were allowed to dry on him. He was treated afterwards for rheumatism of the right knee and pleurodynia. In May he complained of restlessness at night, loss of appetite, debility and emaciation, short dry cough, increased on getting in or out of bed and by speaking loud, swollen right knee etc. He had been in Malta Hospital in 1841 with similar symptoms and had suffered pneumonia at the end of 1845. He had had gonorrhoea before the age of 15 and repeated syphilitic affections had been treated with mercury. He was pale and emaciated, tall and slight in build with a narrow chest, indicating, with the coughing, anorexia and debility, a phthisical habit with a probability of functional derangement of the hepatic system. He returned from sick quarters at Singapore on 17 June without the expected benefit. On 3 September, the surgeon notes that as th ship had been at Mauritius for 10 days he had consulted with Dr Jones of HMS President and Staff Surgeon Robertson, who recommended change of climate. He was sent to the Naval Hospital at Simon's Town in a very precarious state of health, but with some expectation of the climate proving beneficial. Folio 18: Theodoro Miguel, aged 34, Spanish Refugee; disease or hurt, gunshot wounds of right arm. Put on sick list, 22 April 1846, off Borneo. Discharged, 20 May 1846. He had been captured by Bornean pirates at Manila 3 years previously and made a slave. He had escaped on board the Samarang a few days before his injury. From his knowledge of the Malay language he usually accompanied the Captain on surveying excursions. Whilst on one such expedition he was shot in the arm from a thicket close by, the musket ball entering the outside of the arm and exiting 2 inches away. Folio 19: Henry Hurneyman, aged 20, Ordinary Seaman; disease or hurt, fractura phalanges primi pollicis pedis. Put on sick list, 3 April 1846, at sea off the island of Borneo. Discharged, 24 April 1846. Fractured great toe of the right foot by a 7lb rock falling 10 feet on to it while setting up surveying marks. Folios 19-20: George Langlands, aged 22, Seaman; disease or hurt, diarrhoea. Put on sick list, 29 October 1846, at Hong Kong. Discharged, 8 June 1846. Tall and lightly made, having light hair and pale waxy complexion without much muscular development, he had been on the sick list 8 times in the past year and had been prone to diarrhoea since first being seized off the coast of Borneo in 1843. He was treated with calilaban, a species of bastard cinnamon, used at the Spanish settlement of Sambranyan, in the island of Mindanao, where it grows in great abundance. Folio 21: John Boer, aged 26, Able Seaman of the Carpenter's Crew; disease or hurt, rheumatismus. Put on sick list, 23 December 1845. Discharged, 21 February 1846. Described as a man whose conduct has been suspicious of late and by birth a foreigner. He had joined the ship from the hospital ship at Hong Kong when her crew was being reduced in 1844. He complained of severe pains in the back, similar to lumbago, pains of the extremities with weakness and stiffness of the affected parts. He attributed his symptoms to the exertion of sawing planks. He insisted that his back was broken and he could not stand erect, going about the deck on his knees. The surgeon was convinced his symptoms were feigned and had him watched covertly, confirming his suspicions. He prescribed the moxa, made by steeping lint into a solution of nitrewhich was applied on either side of the lumbar vertebrae. He at first stood the pain but very soon he jumped nimbly about, uttering imprecations. The surgeon gave him his opinion of his conduct and the seriousness of his offence and the punishment that would follow any complaint made to the Captain. He was afterward punished for misconduct and using offensive language to his superiors.\",\n",

      "        \"description\": \"Folios 20-23: Surgeon's general remarks. The surgeon has little to add to what has been said about specific diseases in the quarterly returns and will instead record general observations that have occurred during the period. Some of the diseases, such as, phlogosis, catarrhus, cephalalgia, diarrhoea, colica, vulnus and contusio, are typical of ships of war and will always occur, whatever the circumstances. The more aggravated forms tend to be inflammatory diseases and should be easily attributed. Chronic forms are usually found in older seamen, of long service or of long continuation in the tropics, typically, hepatitis, phthisis incipiens, asthma, pneumonia or bronchitis, also dysenteria and rheumatism. Once induced these are liable to return on slight causes in chronic form. Having discussed the prevalent diseases the surgeon goes on to discuss the exceptions detailed in the journal, starting with the \\u0091determinated visceral disease\\u0092 which followed on from severe colica flatulenta. The patient was sent to hospital but returned with his constitution enfeebled and with \\u0091other viscera\\u0092 implicated in the disease. The surgeon discusses the diseases tendency to return particularly when patients have been irregular in their habits, and how disease in any part of the digestive tract must eventually affect the whole body. In the tropics only temporary relief from such conditions can be expected. The two cases that were struck by lightning exhibited vastly different effects, from \\u0091almost entire annihilation of the constitutional energies, through the severe shock sustained in the nervous systems generally\\u0092, to ptosis and loss of vision. The effects of lightning are always dreadful if not fatal, especially at sea, and it is one of the most dangerous things a sailor faces in performing his duties. Both cases recovered to some extent but not entirely, the one being left with \\u0091considerable constitutional enervation and nervous debility\\u0092 and being invalided in consequence, and the other unlikely to fully recover his sight. Since there is little to be added to comments already made on the common ailments affecting sailors in the West Indies, the surgeon goes on to discuss the coast of Central America and ports trading with Jamaica, particularly in respect to disease. The coast is extensive but with few important ports, generally those of capital cities. The coast is low, \\u0091its surface verdant, overrun with parasites of various description\\u0092, with a rich soil beneath thick woods, \\u0091a pregnant source at all times for impure exhalations\\u0092. The interior is more diversified and luxuriant and fertile, producing a variety of crops of commercial value as well as fruits and vegetables, much of which \\u0091yet remains to be rendered available\\u0092. Climate along the coast is influenced by the season, the seasons distinguished as wet or dry. The wet season, from May to November, has light and variable winds, heavy rain and violent thunder and lightning, the air intensely heated, \\u0091soliciting from the moistened soil, continuous intense and impure exhalations\\u0092. The dry season has refreshing diurnal sea breezes and occasional showers. The wet season is in general not so long or continuous in more Eastern parts, in these parts there are two rainy and two dry seasons; rainy from December to February and again from June to August. The parts of the coast most frequently visited, Carthagena, Santa Martha, Chagres and Nicaragua, \\u0091come more in the limits of the rains\\u0092, particularly the latter two. Chagres in particular is notable for giving rise to both continuous and intermittent fevers and is of considerable importance, with Panama, for the transfer of [swails], specie etc. This part of the coast is particularly prone to promotion of disease being densely wooded and uncleared with incessant heavy rain, and a heated and electrical atmosphere. Intermitting fevers are more common, both among natives and Europeans. In seamen intermittent and remittent fevers are produced of a not very active character, approaching synochus. The two cases in the past year both originated on this coast. \\u0091Marsh miasmata, or the effluvia arising from stagnant water, marshy ground or densely wooded countries, when acted upon by heat, are the most frequent exciting causes of this fever\\u0092. In marshes putrefaction of vegetable and animal matter contributes a peculiar quality to the miasmata and it may be presumed that moist atmosphere promotes its action. The disease is also strikingly susceptible to renewal from slight causes and without the repetition of the original causes; the last case noted resulted from a change from a dry to a moist wind. The recurrence of this disease suggests that it leaves a predisposition in the habit, unlike most continued fevers, which once cured leave an individual less susceptible. The politics of the region has never been sufficiently settled for the leaders of these countries to look beyond the major towns to the isolated communities, in the forests or along the coast, where disease is prevalent. The poverty and hardships faced by these communities predispose them to disease and to its renewal on slight causes. The surgeon goes on to consider \\u0091by comparative inference its infrequency amongst seamen as likewise why Europeans suffer its attack on crossing this country\\u0092. The Europeans are mercantile travellers, travelling on bad roads with no shelter and little opportunity for rest or change of clothing, making them prone to the influence of the powerful surrounding miasma. In serving on this station for 7 years, the surgeon has seen only 15 cases amongst seamen, who are not exposed to the same causes and are on vessels where careful attention is paid to cleanliness, ventilation and avoiding damp between decks, excellent provisions, bedding and clothing are provided. Where it does occur it is among seamen who have worked on or visited the shore either when disease was prevalent or, who have worked in conditions promoting a predisposition to attack. He concludes by saying that the causes of disease will remain until \\u0091some further steps are taken more suitable to rid the country of its superabundant woods\\u0092.

There was no contagion, the continued fever that proved fatal was from some local affection of the brain and the intermittent fevers arose from cold and fatigue. There were many more cases of dysentery, scurvy and ulcers than have been recorded. Everyone with an ulcer was allowed five or six fresh lemons a day. Intermittent fevers were frequently slight and paroxysms were prevented by large doses of the Peruvian bark before they were expected. The ship was damp from cruising with the lower ports open a great deal of the time. The Swiftsure was in general cruising off the Canaries or in the Mediterranean, so fresh meat and vegetables were not as easy to procure as they might have been. Captain Hallowell was exceptionally kind to the sick, supplying them with tea every day and good food. There were always sufficient fresh lemons to allow four or five a day to every man with ulcers or any sign of scurvy and also fever. The surgeon apologises for having taken supplies of medicine and stores from the hospital at Lisbon, Peruvian bark and bedding was needed but the surgeon of the hospital would not separate the items so he was obliged to take it all. A great deal of attention was paid to keeping the ship clean and as comfortable as possible. Three men were constantly employed as sentries and nurses in the sick bay, from being so much there they became very useful. Signed, James Dalziel.\",\n",

Because of the healthy nature of the station there is very little to record, there have been no serious illnesses, the most common being catarrhs, phlegmon, venereal affections, diarrhoea and rheumatism. There were a great many venereal cases and many more were not entered on the list. Secondary symptoms were numerous and treatment is discussed briefly. The regulation of prostitution and the \\u2018apprenticeship\\u2019 of prostitutes in the \\u2018Yoshiwara\\u2019 district, and the new regulations which released women into the city, are discussed, and the rise in venereal disease since. Folio 8 relates a court case involving a Chinese indentured labourer who escaped from a Peruvian ship, the Maria Luz, and alleged that he had been ill treated and kidnapped. The Master of the ship engaged Mr F V Dickins (a former Royal Navy Assistant Surgeon) as barrister who contested the claims and put forward that slavery was countenanced by the Japanese Government in the trafficking of young girls for prostitution.

Folios 10 \\u2013 11: William [Yarr], aged 39, Private; disease or hurt, death by drowning, 1 July 1872. An inquest was held at which it was heard that he had been seen entering a house in the Yoshiwara district at 7pm, seen at midnight crossing a bridge by a policeman who shortly afterwards heard him falling in and ran to fetch help. It was believed he had been drinking and had fallen asleep and in hurrying back to the camp fell off the bridge. \\u2018Several deaths have occurred in this way during the last two years; and complaints have been made to the Municipal Director about the insufficiency of the bridges\\u2019.

      "        \"description\": \"Folios 14-18: Surgeon's general remarks. The surgeon starts by saying that the medical history of only 65 persons cannot furnish much to remark on, in the absence of epidemics or contagious disease. They arrived in the Mediterranean in October 1847 and spent the winter in the Adriatic, mostly at Trieste, and from May to September in the Ionian and Aegean seas, Constantinople and Malta. Consequently, they experienced a greater range of temperature than usually found on that station. The effects were catarrhal, pulmonic and rheumatic affections in the cold and dysenteries, diarrhoeas, hepatic and 'ceribral congestions' during the hot weather. There was much more hot than cold weather. The sudden change of temperature, with no change in diet, was a strong cause of disease. The surgeon discusses the temperature on board between decks due to the vessel being made of iron. On calm days windsails provided no ventilation and the closeness was worse. While at anchor in Malta, a thermometer placed on the inside wooden sheathing in one of the after cabins reached 117 degrees Fahrenheit [47.2 Celsius], while the temperature on deck was 86 Fahrenheit [30 Celsius]. The surgeon suspects there must be a problem retaining heat in a cold climate. They suffered most from heat in calm weather and clear sunshine and at anchor in Malta, the reflected heat in the creek made it worse. The surgeon recommends that in iron vessels intended for tropical service, a non conducting substance should be placed between the iron and the wooden sheathing. Statistical analysis of the sick list shows that the daily percentage on the list was low, 2 \\u00bd %, but it varied considerably, with the highest in the summer and autumn. The average duration of cases was similar for all quarters, with the exception of that ending 30th June which had one or two chronic cases. Six cases were sent to hospital, 1 at Woolwich and the other 5 at Malta. Of those sent to hospital at Malta, three subsequently died, William Wright, N S Seabrook and Edward Browning. Browning's case shows 'the difficulty of diagnostics in acute complicated cases'. The late Dr Watt at first believed it to be advanced typhus but afterwards remarked to the surgeon that it was one of 'unusual occurrence' The post mortem was carried out by the Assistant Surgeons of the hospital, Messrs Martin and Hill, and they did not think typhus was the cause of death. Great attention was paid to cleanliness, dryness and ventilation and to proper clothing especially in the night watches. Undue exposure and fatigue were avoided. The chloride of zinc was tried but the conditions were not unusual enough to test it properly. The surgeon gives his opinion that iron vessels are less subject to smells than wooden ones, although water collects between the 'limbers', it does not smell when pumped out. The airtight compartments prevent circulation of air and windsails must be used whenever possible and gratings are preferable to hatches. The chloride of zinc had been used effectively in the holds, store rooms and especially the engine rooms. The mixture of tallow, oil, cinders, ashes and inferior coal, with salt water produced a very offensive effluvia on which the chloride of zinc acted at once. It is far more effective than chloride of lime and a small portion of diluted solution in the bilge prevents any unpleasant odours or sulphurous fumes. The chloride of lime is not so soluble and so cannot be diluted so well. A solution of chloride of zinc is superior to alcohol for preserving anatomical specimens, particularly brains and livers, and especially in a warm and confined atmosphere where alcohol tends to evaporate. There were two cases of cholera, a relatively mild one at Constantinople, and a more severe, 'Asiatic' cholera, after leaving Malta. Cholera was prevalent at both places but these cases were traced to irregularities of diet. Both men recovered. The surgeon discusses some 'unusual' features of the cholera epidemic in Constantinople. It did not appear to be contagious or capable of transmission from the infected to the healthy. Cases broke out across the city and did not appear confined to one area or household. Considering the want of sanitary regulations, the ill ventilated houses, narrow streets, close bazaars, open sewerage, cemeteries in the centre of the living, in short, 'everything tending to spread a pestilential distemper', the surgeon suggests this is 'negative proof of the absence of an infectious propagation of cholera such as it appeared in Constantinople in 1848'. The surgeon dismisses an 'epidemic influence' as making it difficult to account for there being only one case in the first 8 days of the disease. He goes on to suggest diarrhoea and colica may produce a predisposition to cholera but they may themselves be attributed to the amount of cucumber, water melon and fruits that are eaten, rather than the influence of a 'specific choleraic cause'. It would be too much to suggest that cholera itself was produced from those causes. The disease was almost entirely confined to the lower orders and the attacks could be traced to irregularities in eating or drinking. The Turkish physicians considered the disease to be [algestive] fever with a prolonged and often fatal cold stage and their treatment consisted of bleeding. The mortality rate decreased but the surgeon suggests this may have been due to other causes. The two cases on the Antelope were treated as though infectious and were isolated in the fore saloon and the chloride of zinc used in cleaning utensils and bedding etc used in treatment. One boy, Jonathan Pierce, was invalided and given a pension certificate for hernia and cataracts, both conditions existed before his joining the Antelope from HMS Poictiers.

There were three deaths from fever on board this ship and one on shore at Sierra Leone, the deceased William Harris, Able Seaman and Jonn Redington, Ordinary Seaman, left the Rapid along with two men and Lieutenant Mansfield from the Waterwitch to navigate a joint prize for adjudication at the Vice Admiralty Court at Sierra Leone, during the passage three prisoners took opportunity when two men were asleep and other two aloft engaged about the sails and Lieutenant Mansfield at the helm, to rise upon them with intention of regaining possession of the ship, as a result Lieutenant Mansfield and all his men were wounded before they succeeded in overcoming them. They reached Sierra Leone with great difficulty and fatigue, two men got fever there when on board the Rolla and were sent to hospital, Harris died two days after, J. Redington recovered and rejoined his vessel. The Surgeon attributed the cause of fever that prevailed on board the ship to exposure to the dews and sun, and he stated that the convalescence from the fever was tedious, owing in his opinion that he had no quinine.\",\n",
