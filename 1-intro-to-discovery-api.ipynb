    "## What is Discovery\n",
    "\n",
    "[Discovery](https://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/) is the catalogue for [The National Archives](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/). It contains descriptions of over 32 million records held by The National Archives and more than 2,500 archives across the country. Over 9 million records are available for download. \n",
    "\n",
    "Powering Discovery is a database; it is this database that stores the information about each record and is queried every time (either by the web user interface, or the API). It is the sheer number of records in Discovery that make using the API a valuable option. Rather than having to use the web interface separately for each unique query, following the rest of this notebook you will be able to automate its use - allowing you to filter more efficiently and retrieve large amounts of data more effectively.

This provides information on what requests you can build: what endpoints are available, what query parameters you can use, what methods they accept, and so on. This information is often provided either directly alongside, or is similarly accessible as, the API. \n",

    " \"Discovery API documentation\" will bring up the [main help page](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/help/discovery-for-developers-about-the-application-programming-interface-api/). Some information is available here - particularly the terms of use and information on catalogue levels. From this page, you can find the [API sandbox](https://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/API/sandbox/index). This page provides you with an interactive way to test out the API, and see what data you can retrieve. It also works as documentation. \n",

    "The first thing we find wen looking into the sandbox is the number of different paths/endpoints available. This represents the variety of works typically undertaken with the Archives. You may be looking for the authority about a record, or you may be looking for details about a record with a specific identification. If we investigate these endpoints closer, we can see that they all require an identification number for the record(s) being investigated. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the purpose of this Notebook, we are going to stick to searching for records. So, we will stick to the very last endpoint in the list: `/search/records`. The documentation shows us that this endpoint will accept GET requests only, logical for a search API. \n",

For simplicity, we are marking them all as false for this first example. Note that search query is not on this list - it is required, and so will be added to the request regardless.\n"
