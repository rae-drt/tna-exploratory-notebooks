    "## What is Discovery\n",
    "\n",
    "[Discovery](https://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/) is the catalogue for [The National Archives](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/). It contains descriptions of over 32 million records held by The National Archives and more than 2,500 archives across the country. Over 9 million records are available for download. \n",
    "\n",
    "The archive is split into record series, with series split into lower and lower levels. At the highest level, record series typically represent Governmental Departments (if the record is held by TNA) or Archive (if the record is held elsewhere). Note: TNA holds records from the last 1,000 years – there are departments that no longer exist, so the list of departments may be longer than expected. \n",
    "\n",
    "The list of record series/departments can be found here – {url}. For these notebooks, we will be focusing on records at TNA, so start by selecting the first letter of the department you are looking for. Selecting details of your record series at this level provides an overview of the series, including a description, date range, and physical description, among other data. \n",
    "\n",
    "The other option is to browse by hierarchy – the boxes to the side of the main list. These are the first “child” level series of the main series selected on the left of the page. Clicking on their details button provides similar details to the main record series (although often to a reduced level), while clicking on their title takes you one level “deeper” into the hierarchy. These steps can be repeated, until you reach a page such as this – this is the edge of the tree, each entry on a page like this are actual records. \n",
    "\n",
    "Powering Discovery is a database; it is this database that stores the information about each record and is queried every time (either by the web user interface, or the API). It is the sheer number of records in Discovery that make using the API a valuable option. Rather than having to use the web interface separately for each unique query, following the rest of this notebook you will be able to automate its use - allowing you to filter more efficiently and retrieve large amounts of data more effectively.

    "## Gathering information\n",
    "\n",
    "The key thing you need when working with an API is the documentation. This provides information on what requests you can build: what endpoints are available, what query parameters you can use, what methods they accept, and so on. This information is often provided either directly alongside, or is similarly accessible as, the API. \n",
    "\n",
    "The [main help page](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/help/discovery-for-developers-about-the-application-programming-interface-api/) provides useful information - particularly the terms of use, information on catalogue levels, and requests to limit rates of use. From this page, you can navigate to the [API sandbox](https://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/API/sandbox/index). This page works as more thorough documentation of the API's functionality - showing available endpoints, parameters, and responses. The sandbox is interactive, allowing you to build and test requests in the browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this stage, try it out! Have a go with the sandbox and see what you can retrieve.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a range of bits of information that are key and can be gathered from the sandbox. These include the base URL, endpoints relevent to queries we want to make and the methods these endpoints use. "
