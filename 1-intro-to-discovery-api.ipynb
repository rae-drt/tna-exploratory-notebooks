    "The key thing to investigate when starting to work with an API is the documentation. This should provide all the required information to start building requests: the base URL, endpoints, parameters, etcetera. For Discovery, the main body of documentation is the [API sandbox](https://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/API/sandbox/index). This page provides a list of available endpoints and details on how to use them. \n",

Note that in the screenshot below, a considerable chunk of this section has been cropped out - the notebook would be too long if we included it all!\n",
    "- Section 3 lists the response status codes you may expect from the endpoint.\n",
    "- If you press the \"Try it out!\" button, subsequent sections are revealed. \n",
    "- The first new section (4) show the URL that was built with the query parameters and endpoint, generating a request to the API; and an example cURL request sending the request to the API.\n",

    "With the number of results found, it may be beneficial to narrow our search to specific record series. Record series are the way TNA organises its records. [At the top level](https://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/browse), records are divided by [governmental department](https://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/browse/r/h/C1) (if held by TNA) or by [external archive](https://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/browse/r/A). For example, records from the Admiralty are held under [ADM](https://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/browse/r/h/C4), while [MCA](https://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/browse/r/h/C412) holds the records of the Maritime and Coastguard Agency. Within these departments, records are divided into numeric series, collecting offices within a department (for example). Records can then be further divided into sub-series (several times). \n",
    "\n",
    "Helpfully, TNA has provided research guides for many of the record series it holds, which can be found on the [TNA website](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/help-with-your-research/research-guides/). These guides cover a wide range of topics, providing good overviews of the records held by TNA, including important record series. To find information about Royal Navy ships called \"Ajax\", then the guide on [how to find logs and records from Royal Navy ships](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/help-with-your-research/research-guides/royal-navy-ships-voyages-log-books/) will be particularly helpful. From this, we can create a list of record series. The list is available in the [additional resources](./aditional_data.py).\n",
    "\n",
    "From the documentation, we can see that record series are included with the \"sps.recordSeries\" parameter. When testing with the sandbox, we can see that if we add multiple record series, the sandbox creates a URL with a new \"sps.recordSeries\" parameter for each record series.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this information, we can write the code block below to build the API query. \n"
