The second cluster then maps to the [1901 ship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Bedford_(1901)), which was wrecked in 1910, resulting in the chronologically shorter cluster of records."

The graph is too small, just like the bar charts, and a lot of the points are squashed together on 0 length, when there may be some variation there.
