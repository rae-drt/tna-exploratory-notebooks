It could be used, for example, to display a book, containing a series of images of the pages, along with transcriptions of the text on each page, and annotations made by users.\n",

    "\n",
    "IIIF manifests are made of a series of nested components in a hierarchical tree structure. Each component can generally have multiple children of the level below, with collections specifically being allowed to have child collections. The main components, using the example of a book to describe their contents, are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Collection** - A collection of manifests, for example the collected works of an author.\n",
    "- **Manifest** - A single book, containing pages and metadata.\n",
    "- **Canvas** - A single page of the book, possibly containing multiple images or paragraphs of text.\n",
    "- **Annotation page** - A page of annotations. \n",
    "- **Annotation** - A single annotation - information about a paragraph, or a region of an image.\n",
    "- **Content** - The content of the annotation, rather than the descriptive metadata. An annotation might have multiple content items, for example a paragraph of text and a region of an image.\n",

    "\n",
    "The most effective way to learn a toolset is to use it, so here we are going to build a simple IIIF manifest from scratch by building a manifest for [this 1334 court roll](https://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C9060661) from the National Archives. This document is free to view, and can serve as a good example of a simple document to display. Note that, while the base URL we are going to use is live, the manifest we are going to create will contain many placeholders acting as examples of what you might expect to see - creating hypothetical URIs that are not live.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of building a manifest can run in either direction - either starting with collecting individual annotations onto their canvas, and working up to the manifest, or starting with the manifest and adding the details. The exact workflow for situations you may encounter will depend on the tools and data you have available. Here, we are going to start with the manifest and work down. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note about complexity: the manifest built here is going to be simple, with the required fields and a few extra details to work with the example document. Manifests can be built up into much more complex and rich documents, allowing the display of a large amount of content. "

Annotations illustrate where fields can become required based on content - annotations containing OCR data must have the motivation `supplementing`. "

This opens a powerful feature of IIIF - the manifest does not need to contain all the information, only the references to it.\n",

This allows you to store a large number of annotations without making the manifest unwieldy. When reading the manifest, the client reaches the ID - then, rather than reading further within the manifest for annotations, it sends a request to the server. The use of the W3C Web Annotation Data Model standard allows this process - the client can be confident that the annotations will be in a format it can understand."
