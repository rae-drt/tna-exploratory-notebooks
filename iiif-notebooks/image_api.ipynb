    "Requests for images come in the form of URIs, and can be independent requests (as in, a user puts the URL into a browser), but are more often used in the context of a IIIF viewer, or as part of a IIIF manifest. The URI contains all the information needed to request the image, with the standard defining what information is needed and how it should be formatted. This information is presented in 5 parts, appended onto a base url. The base URI should not actually request the image, instead it should point towards the resource - the additional information then tells the server exactly what view of the image is requested. For this example, we will be building the TNA example up, and adjusting the Bodleian example at each stage to show how the URI changes."
