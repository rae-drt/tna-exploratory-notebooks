# Named Entity Recognition (NER)

This case study introduces [HuggingFace library](https://huggingface.co) which can be used to access various LLM models. For this case study, the task of NER is worked upon.

## Libraries

- [Transformer](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/index)
- [BERT](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/model_doc/bert) BERT is an "encoder only" transformer architecture. 
- [bert-base-NER] bert-base-NER is the finetuned model of BERT which is used for the task of NER.
- [BART](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/model_doc/bart) BART is an "ecoder decoder" transformer architecture. 
- [mgenre-wiki] mgenere-wiki is the fintuned model of BART used for named entity linking.
